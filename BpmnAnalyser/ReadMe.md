# BpmnAnalyser

This project contains the BPMN analysis and metric extraction component used in the thesis.

---

## Purpose

The **BpmnAnalyser** computes structural and quality-based **output comparison metrics (OM)** by comparing BPMN models generated by different systems against expert-created reference models.  

The resulting metrics are exported as CSV files and used for subsequent **statistical analysis** and **prediction tasks**.

---

## Project Structure

### `src/main/java`
Contains the main analysis logic.  
The program is executed via the `Main` class.

### `src/main/resources/bpmn`
Contains BPMN models used as input for the analysis.  
Subfolders correspond to different systems and anonymisation levels:

- **Aalst** – PromoAI  
- **Aau** – BPMN-Chatbot  
- **Meins** – BPMN_Prototype  

### `src/main/resources/bpmn/experts`
Contains expert-created reference BPMN models used as ground truth for comparison.  
These reference models are **not publicly available** and are therefore incomplete in this repository.

### `src/main/resources/Output`
Contains the generated CSV output files produced by the analyser.  
These files include all computed OM metrics and **do not contain sensitive information**.  
The exported results represent the complete output of the analysis stage used in the thesis.

---

## Execution

The program is started via the `Main` class.

During execution, it:

1. Loads BPMN models from `src/main/resources/bpmn`
2. Compares system-generated models against expert reference models
3. Computes structural and quality-related OM metrics
4. Exports all results as CSV files to `src/main/resources/Output`

---

## Reproducibility and Limitations

This repository cannot be fully executed end-to-end, because:

- Only data from the highest anonymisation level (**A2**) is included
- Expert reference BPMN models cannot be published due to confidentiality constraints

However, **all final generated outputs (CSV files)** are included and allow full inspection of the analysis results used in the thesis.

---

## Relation to the Thesis

This component corresponds to the **automated output metric computation stage** and provides the OM features used for:

- Expert rating prediction  
- Feature selection  
- Anonymisation impact analysis
